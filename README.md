# markdown-editor

This is a fork of [JBT's markdown-editor](https://github.com/jbt/markdown-editor). It's designed to have a number of nice properties:

- Use NPM for dependency management to make it easy to update stuff
- Be super lightweight for speed and small download times
- Be self-contained in one CSS and one JS file
